# Release Process

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive release process for Chahuadev Sentinel, ensuring consistent, high-quality releases across all distribution channels.

## Release Philosophy

### Quality Assurance

**Testing Standards**:
- All automated tests must pass before release
- Manual testing of critical functionality required
- Performance regression testing for major releases
- Security vulnerability assessment for all releases

**Documentation Requirements**:
- All new features must have complete documentation
- API changes require updated reference documentation
- Migration guides for breaking changes
- Release notes with clear change descriptions

**Stability Commitment**:
- No known critical bugs in release candidates
- Backward compatibility maintained unless explicitly noted
- Clear deprecation timeline for removed features
- Rollback procedures tested and documented

### Release Cadence

**Regular Schedule**:
- Major releases: Every 6-12 months
- Minor releases: Every 2-3 months
- Patch releases: As needed, typically weekly
- Security releases: Immediate for critical issues

**Planning Cycles**:
- Annual roadmap with major release milestones
- Quarterly minor release planning sessions
- Monthly patch release evaluations
- Continuous security monitoring and response

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) strictly:

**Major Releases (x.0.0)**
- Breaking changes to public APIs
- Removal of deprecated features
- Significant architectural changes
- New platform or runtime requirements

**Minor Releases (x.y.0)**
- New features with backward compatibility
- Performance improvements without breaking changes
- New optional configuration options
- Additional language or platform support

**Patch Releases (x.y.z)**
- Bug fixes maintaining backward compatibility
- Security vulnerability patches
- Documentation corrections and improvements
- Minor performance optimizations

### Pre-release Versions

**Alpha Releases (x.y.z-alpha.n)**
- Early development builds for internal testing
- May contain incomplete features or known issues
- Not recommended for production use
- Frequent releases during active development

**Beta Releases (x.y.z-beta.n)**
- Feature-complete releases for community testing
- API stable but implementation may change
- Suitable for development and testing environments
- Community feedback actively incorporated

**Release Candidates (x.y.z-rc.n)**
- Production-ready candidates for final validation
- No new features, only critical bug fixes
- Extensive testing by maintainers and community
- Final version unless critical issues discovered
